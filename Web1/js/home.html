            <p><b>Thank you for visiting my Website!</b></p>
            <p>
                This is my first website I have made. I added a few pictures of some projects I have worked on for Genspark. The first pic is 
                of a Dragon Cave Assignment, where you guess which cave is the correct one. The next Pic is of Hangman, programmed with Functional
                programming. The next is a group Project, where we had to display sorted information from a file and place it into a grid format.
                The fourth picture is Humans VS Goblins, GUI. You play the human and by pressing the arrow keys you can move around, and hunt the 
                Goblins. 
            </p>
            <p>I am very happy to be working as a programmer. I found I have a major passion for Software Development
                I am excited to learn more about Programming.
